                    GemEvolution brings unique gemstones to digital world using blockchain technology. We use Non-fungible tokens to represent ownership for each individual gemstone. 
                    Users can trade the tokens without friction while gemstones are secure in vault. Minting cost is always close to wholesale price of selected gemstone for best possible investment.
                    NFTs can be sold on marketplaces at any time as long as off-chain gemstone is not claimed. Each NFT contains 1 original off-chain gemstone which will be delivered if requested. 
                    Since all of our NFTs have only 1 original off-chain gemstone, once its claimed next owner will have option to pay fee (depending on gemstone specifications and size) and request copy off-chain gemstone.

                    Synthetic assets are relatively new in the rapidly evolving world of DeFi. They are digital
                    cryptographic assets that represent commodities like gold and silver, stablecoins, fiat currencies,
                    and similar
                    financial instruments.<br /><br />
                    This innovative capability gives investors the opportunity to invest using leverage into traditional
                    asset classes on Binance Smart Chain, through Sparta's underlying protocol.<br /><br />
                    Spartan Protocol allows the generation of synthetic-yield (SynthYield) assets ontop of curated BEP20 pooled assets on Binance Smart Chain (BSC),
                    using price anchors offered by its own liquidity pools, minted by any listed BEP20 token and
                    collateralised behind the scenes by the underlying LP tokens with no user CDP position to manage.<br /><br />
                    This is done through the use of code. As Spartan Protocol is decentralized and community-driven,
                    you do not need to rely on any intermediary. It is a trustless process.<br /><br />
                    All assets on the platform are pegged to the price of the protocol's token; Therefore, there is no
                    need for the use of any external pricing oracles.<br /><br />

            </h2>
            <p>
                Leveraged synthetic assets are one of the fundamental reasons we're developing Spartan
                Protocol. These planned derivatives are completely unique to Spartan Protocol
                and can not be found anywhere else in DeFi.<br /><br />
                Based on the currently proposed implementation; for the first phase of SpartanSynths, the main utility
                will be to enable users to swap any listed BEP20 asset for a SynthYield asset exposing them to the yield benefits of providing liquidity without the impermanent loss exposure. All this without the need of know-your-customer processes
                nor relying on any centralized exchange.<br /><br />
                This in essence is 'going long' on the asset underlying the synth (ie. if you wanted to 'short the market' during a bear cycle, you could mint a synthetic stablecoin like BUSDs and park that SynthYield token in the SynthVault to earn yield on your stablecoin).
                For another example; if you thought BNB was about to pump; you could mint BNBs and park it in the SynthVault to not only benefit from the appreciating BNB asset price; but also have it earning compounding interest.
                The incentives are aligned with longer-term positions however, similar to providing liquidity in the pools, so the benefits are much greater over long periods and not really suitable for short-term day-trading.<br /><br />
                At first, the assets with the deepest liquidity pools on the platform will be supported. Only assets
                that have enough internal liquidity to support a floating SynthYield supply will be curated.<br /><br />
                Synths will likely include at first (but not be limited to):
            </p>
            <li>BNB</li>
            <li>BUSD</li>
            <li>USDT</li>
            <li>BTCB</li>
            <p>
                <br />
                Future phases could theoretically include supporting a basket of BEP20 assets, rather than 1 particular
                asset. As well as any gold-backed or stock-backed BEP-20 asset. 
                But for now, the goal is to enable yield-generating synthetic assets for Spartans who are hesitant to 
                provide liquidity or looking to hedge/customize the capital exposed by their liquidity position.<br /><br />

            <h2 id="design" class="mb-4"><img src="./assets/Pictograms/SVG/picto_blockchain.svg" />How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                In order to obtain a synthetic asset on Spartan Protocol, users need to first hold (or purchase) any listed BEP20 tokens (including SPARTA).
                Users can swap these assets for the SynthYield tokens using the swap rate of the pool.
                These tokens are then added via an asymmetric-liquidity-add to the relevant pool.
                The LP tokens minted from that liquidity-add are held by the Synth's token contract; which handles the debt position for the user behind the scenes.
                Their position is always fully collateralized no matter the movements of the market. This is because the minting and burning of Synths use the internal pool's pricing and balances.
                <br /><br />
                Synths can be enabled for the creation of any asset enabled by the DAO.
                As communicated above, the protocol first enables this with the assets that have the deepest liquidity
                pools.
                Synths mimic the value of the created asset (ie. 1BNB = ~1BNBs) however, just like performing a swap; there is a slip fee that is paid to the liquidity providers.
                The rate will be better the deeper the pools are. Synths require deep liquidity in their underlying pools to support healthy rates.
                <br /><br />
                By obtaining these synthetic assets, you are basically entering a 'long position' of the underlying asset.
                The LP tokens (and underlying base assets) acts as collateral, whereas the minted assets act as debt.
                If the value of the collateral increases, the DAO can vote to 'realise' the profits to the liquidity providers by creating a proposal to call the 
                realise function which burns the LP-token premium thereby reducing the LP token supply and attributing more of the pooled assets to the actual LP token holders.
                <br /><br />
                A special 'compound contract' has been proposed and implementations have already been built with the
                purpose of enabling users to plug in synthetics to either increase or decrease the leverage of their
                position.
                This may or may not make it to the mainnet implementation as it's own separate contract, but the point
                is that there is a focus on providing the ability for decentralised peers to leverage up their positions
                in this ecosystem!
                <br /><br />
                Liquidity pool shares are on-market, value-stabilised and can be instantly liquidated.
                Liquidity-sensitive fees & dynamic caps to the amount of synths that can be minted vs the pool's token depth ensure positions taken up will scale with the depth of available liquidity,
                preventing deleveraging spirals common to other systems.<br /><br />

            <p>
                Synthetic assets are not live yet on mainnet. However an older implementation is availbel now on testnet in the dapp.
                <br /><br />
                We recommend you to join our social channels to stay tuned for updates from our community contributors.
                The wider community is welcome to join in on the current testnet and more importantly the next big testnet launch.
                <br /><br />
                A tutorial on the creation of synthetic assets is to follow up after mainnet V2 is launched.
                <br /><br />
                Users that wish to interact with the protocol do need a few things:
            </p>
            <li>A wallet that can connect to Binance Smart Chain.</li>
            <li>SPARTA Tokens: acquired by swapping BEP20 assets on <a href='https://dapp.spartanprotocol.org'>SpartanPools</a> or purchased on <a
                    href='https://www.binance.com/en/trade/SPARTA_BNB'>Binance CEX</a></li>
            <li>BEP20 Tokens: you may need other BEP20 assets, for instance when providing liquidity to the pools</li>
